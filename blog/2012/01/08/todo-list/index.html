<div class="entry-content"><p>Up to this point, I have simply been working on whatever I felt I needed to do
in the order I felt I needed to do it.  While this works for projects without
set requirements or a set due date, this project has a certain set of
functionality requirements, and it is due at the end of the quarter, which is
why I have taken some time this week to determine what I would like to have in
the final game and how long I expect each of those features to take (based on my
current rate of progress).</p>

<h2>Feature Listing</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Character movement/interaction (1 week)</p>

<p>Because I am using a physics simulation for the world, I need to integrate
the character into that simulation in order for the character to interact with
the world.  Furthermore, I want the camera to be 3rd person, so I need to
introduce a 3D model of the character and animate that model.</p></li>
<li><p>Models (1 week)</p>

<p>I am not a graphic designer, and I don&#8217;t want to pretend to be.  I plan on
&#8216;borrowing&#8217; models from an existing game, but I am unsure to the process (other
than I know it is possible).  It will be useful to have a determined set of
models before attempting to design levels, in case the models are different
proportions than I expect.</p></li>
<li><p>Forking time (1 week)</p>

<p>I can currently rewind time, but that always keeps the same number of
objects in the simulation.  Forking time will require introducing new objects
into the scene and contains a good number of unknowns that I have not yet
explored.</p></li>
<li><p>Level design (1 week)</p>

<p>The component that will absolutely determine this game&#8217;s success is the
quality of its levels.  I need a good chunk of time to design and build the
levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Audio system (1 week)</p>

<p>One of the more fun aspects of this game.  I want to have ambient sound
effects and music (as most games do), except I want the audio react to how the
user is manipulating time.  For example, if the user rewinds time at 2x, the
audio will backwards at 2x.  I know OpenAL provides this functionality, but I
have never actually used the library before.</p></li>
<li><p>Main menu (.5 week)
A minor feature, but it is nice to not immediately be thrown into the game
after launching it.  It would also be nice to track the user&#8217;s progress and let
them save and load games.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are plenty of other things that I would <strong>like</strong> to do but don&#8217;t think I
will have time to do.  Examples include, but are not limited to: Python
integration, S-3D rendering, and space manipulation (via portals).</p>

<h2>Making more time</h2>

<p>Quickly adding up my time estimates, I come up with 5.5 weeks.  Well there are
5.5 weeks left in the quarter, so this should be no problem to finish on time,
right?  I would like to answer &#8220;yes&#8221;, but I know from past experience that I
tend to underestimate my time requirements, overestimate my free time, and do
not foresee all of the problems that I will face.  I typically like to include a
20% time buffer to account for those unknowns, and this current setup does not
provide that.  Still, I based these time estimates on my current work load.  I
have been prioritizing Senior Project over this project during the quarter, and
I think it is a good time to switch priorities since our Senior Project is ahead
of schedule.  With this change, I believe that I can finish this project by the
end of 10th week, but I do not want to discard the possibility that it will take
longer.</p>
