## Game Overview

Continuum is a game that explores certain properties of time that we have come
to assume could not be violated.  What if, for example, you could rewind time,
fixing any mistakes you have made?  What if you were able to jump back in time
and help yourself accomplish something?  Continuum explores these two
questions.

This is you.  You are presented with puzzles and you know you must solve them.

Buttons can be activated by either pushing cubes onto them or by standing on
them yourself.  Activating buttons do things like open doors.

Teleporters are the goal.  Reach a teleporter, and you have solved the level.
This may sound easy, but don't worry, bending time doesn't come naturally.

## How to Play

Continuum plays like most First Person Shooters (FPS's) with a few
modifications.  It supports your basic movement keys (move with WASD, jump with
SPACE, and use the mouse to look around).  Continuum also introduces some
controls allow the manipulation of time, as outlined below:

* ALT: Holding ALT will enter 'time control' mode and will initially freeze
time.  From this state, you can use the scroll wheel to either move time
backwards or forwards.  Scroll up to accelerate the rate that time moves
forwards, and scroll down to accelerate the rate that time moves backwards.  To
exit this mode, simply release ALT.

* P: Save a screenshot.  Useful for making blog articles.

* Left click: Set a marker.  The point in time that you specify as a marker will
be the point in time that you can jump back to at a later time. 

* Right click: Jump back to marker.  Jumping back to a marker will clone
yourself.  You can watch your clone do what you just did (up until the point
that you jumped back in time), and furthermore, you are free to do anything you
want during this time.  It's like teamwork, but you are working with yourself.

* Middle click: Freeze time.  Tap ALT to unfreeze.
