## Commit log

As expected, I have not been able to work on this project as much as I would
have liked to this week, but I was still able to implement the ability to fork
time.  With this new ability, levels that were impossible can now be solved.

    Commits:
    Animate ghost mesh +.5h
    Allow time to rewind past a fork +.5h
    Implement most of forking time +1.5h
    Allow basic jumping back to a marker +.75h
    Replay user input when playing time forwards +1h
    Allow Player controller to be rewound +3h

    Total: 7.25

For the remainder of the quarter, I would like to add a few more levels and will
write the user/designer documentation so that people can make levels for the
game (and play them) in the future.
